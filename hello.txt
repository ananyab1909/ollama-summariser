I am a teenager, and I have lost my parents in an airplane crash. I have been in coma for two months.
I am facing partial memory lapses, and I sometimes I experience panic attacks.
I am seventeen years old and our flight had crashed killing over 200 passengers.
This was our last family trip before my parents divorced.
But it turned to be the last family trip for real. I dont know how to survive now.
I am constantly trying to be hopeful, but I am unable to have faith.
I feel everyone is lying to me.
I hear the nurses and doctor talk about a brain surgery I am about to have
Will they cut my neck? My god. I am so scared
